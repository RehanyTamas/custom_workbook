## UiPath

### What is RPA?
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) refers to the use of software robots or "bots" to automate repetitive, rule-based tasks within business processes.
These tasks are typically manual, time-consuming, and prone to human error
RPA robots mimic human interactions with software applications and systems by interacting with user interfaces, manipulating data, and executing predefined actions.

### What is UiPath?
UiPath is one of the leading providers of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) software, offering a platform for automating repetitive, rule-based tasks.
Low-code (Visual, drag-and-drop approach, wide range of pre-built activities.)

### What are the differences between attended and unattended robots?
Attended robots work alongside human employees, assisting them with tasks in real-time.
These typically require user interaction.
Unattended robots operate autonomously, executing tasks without human intervention.

### What are selectors?
They are used to identify UI elements within applications or web pages.
For this pupose they can use various elements, such as id, name, class, tag, parentid.
There are also dynamic sleectors, which can be used to refer to elements, which's tes change on refresh. (Syntax: *)

### Explain data scraping in UiPath?
Data scraping in UiPath involves extracting data from websites or web applications.
UiPath automatically creates selectors to locate similar data elements on web pages, enabling the extraction of tables, lists Ã­and other strucured data.

### What is low-code?
Low-code development refers to a software development approach that allows developers to create applications with minimal hand-coding.
Typically through a visual interface or configuration rather than traditional programming.
The goal of low-code platforms is to enable rapid application development and streamline the development process.

## CQRS

### What is CQRS, and what problem does it address in software architecture?
CQRS stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation.
It is an architectural pattern that separates read and write operations (commands and queries) into two distinct paths.

### Explain the concept of commands and queries in the context of CQRS.
Commands: Actions that change the state of the system (e.g., creating a new record, updating an existing record).
Queries represent requests for data retrieval or querying existing state.

### What are the benefits of using CQRS in software development?
Improved scalability (independent scaling of read and write operations)
Better performance optimization (diferent optimization for the two sides)
Enhanced flexibility in handling complex domain logic (commands can encapsulate complex business rules and workflows without being constrained by the requirements of read operations.)
Improved maintainability (due to the distinct models and logic, changes or updates to one path are less likely to impact the other)

### Discuss the challenges and trade-offs associated with implementing CQRS in a software project.
Implementing CQRS introduces complexities such as maintaining consistency between read and write models.
Managing eventual consistency, and ensuring synchronization between command and query paths.

### What is event sourcing in CQRS?
Event sourcing involves capturing all changes to the application state as a sequence of events.
These events represent facts or immutable records of what has happened in the system.
These events are then stored and can be replayed to rebuild the application state.
Event sourcing enables a complete audit trail of system state changes.
CQRS complements event sourcing by providing separate read and write models that can be optimized independently.

### What factors should be considered when deciding whether to adopt CQRS in a software project?
Complexity of domain logic: Applications with complex domain logic that may benefit from a clearer separation of write and read concerns.
Scalability requirements:Applications with varying workloads.
Performance requirements: Applications with demanding performance requirements, especially for read-heavy workload.
Development team experience: Adopting CQRS requires a solid understanding of the underlying principles and best practices.

### Specific use cases or domains where CQRS is well-suited include?
Financial systems: Financial transactions often have complex business rules and scalability requirements that align well with CQRS (Bonus points for event sourcing).
Analytics and reporting: Systems requiring real-time or near-real-time access to large volumes of data.
Collaboration platforms: Complex concurrency requirements that can be addressed using CQRS.

## Tailwind

### What is Tailwind CSS?
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allow you to quicly style your project composing classes to style your HTML elements.

### What is the difference between Tailwind and Bootstrap?
**Approach:**
  - Tailwind follows a utility-first approach, where styles are applied directly to HTML elements using utility classes, resulting in granular control (let's you assign aproperties to elements)
  - Bootstrap is a component-based framework that provides pre-designed UI components (ex.:buttons, forms, and navigation bars...etc.) 

**Customization:**
  - Tailwind is highly customizable, allowing developers to configure default styles, add custom utilities, and extend functionality using plugins. Developers have fine-grained control over every      aspect of styling.
  - Bootstrap offers some level of customization, but it is more challenging to deviate from Bootstrap's default styling and components without overriding or extending its core styles.

**Flexibility vs. Convention:**
  - Tailwind offers maximum flexibility, allowing developers maximum freedom in their designs.
  - Bootstrap provides a set of conventions and design patterns that help maintain consistency across projects. While this can be beneficial for rapid development and team collaboration, it may         limit design creativity.
    
### What is Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation in Tailwind CSS?
JIT compilation dynamically generates CSS during development, eliminating the need for pre-built stylesheets, allowing developers to see style changes instantly without waiting for a full rebuild.

### What strategies can be employed to customize or extend Tailwind CSS?
Tailwind offers various customization options such as modifying the default configuration file, creating custom utilities or use Tailwind plugins to extend its functionality.

### Can you explain the concept of "purge" in Tailwind CSS and its significance for production builds?
Purge is a process in Tailwind CSS where unused styles are removed from the final production build. This significantly reduces the size of the generated CSS file, improving page load times and overall performance.
  
### What are the primary challenges of Tailwind CSS?
Tailwiind has a steeper learning curve for those unfamiliar with utility-first frameworks.
